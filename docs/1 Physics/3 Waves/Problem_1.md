# Problem 1  

Water Surface Wave Interference  

## 1. Theoretical Background  

### Wave Interaction  
When multiple waves propagate across a water surface, their amplitudes combine based on the principle of superposition. This results in regions where waves enhance each other (constructive interference) and regions where they cancel out (destructive interference). The pattern formed depends on the phase difference and spacing of the wave sources.

The function \( \eta(x, y, t) \) represents the displacement of a circular wave generated by a source located at \( (x_0, y_0) \), given by:

\[
\eta(x, y, t) = \frac{A}{\sqrt{r}} \cos(kr - \omega t + \phi)
\]

where:  
- \( A \) is the peak amplitude of the wave,  
- \( k = \frac{2\pi}{\lambda} \) is the wave number, which depends on wavelength \( \lambda \),  
- \( \omega = 2\pi f \) is the angular frequency, determined by the wave's frequency \( f \),  
- \( r = \sqrt{(x - x_0)^2 + (y - y_0)^2} \) is the radial distance from the wave source,  
- \( \phi \) is the initial phase shift of the wave.  

When multiple wave sources exist, the total displacement at any point is determined by the sum of the contributions from each individual source:

\[
\eta_{\text{total}}(x, y, t) = \sum_{i=1}^{N} \eta_i(x, y, t)
\]

where:  
- \( N \) represents the total number of wave sources,  
- \( \eta_i(x, y, t) \) is the displacement caused by the \( i \)-th wave source at position \( (x, y) \) and time \( t \).  

This principle forms the basis of wave interference, where constructive and destructive interference patterns emerge based on phase relationships between the individual waves.

## 2. Problem Setup

### 1. Defining a Symmetric Configuration  
A regular polygon (e.g., equilateral triangle, square, or pentagon) is chosen, with wave sources positioned at its vertices.

### 2. Calculating Wave Superposition  
Each vertex serves as a distinct wave emitter, and the total interference pattern is determined by summing the wave contributions from all sources.

---

## 3. Computational Model  
Below is a Python script designed to simulate and visualize the resulting interference pattern.

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Define wave parameters
A = 1  # Amplitude
lambda_ = 10  # Wavelength
k = 2 * np.pi / lambda_  # Wave number
omega = 2 * np.pi  # Angular frequency (arbitrary unit)
t = 0  # Time snapshot

# Define polygon vertices (square as an example)
N = 4  # Number of sources (square)
radius = 20  # Distance from center
angles = np.linspace(0, 2 * np.pi, N, endpoint=False)
sources = [(radius * np.cos(a), radius * np.sin(a)) for a in angles]

# Define grid for visualization
x = np.linspace(-30, 30, 300)
y = np.linspace(-30, 30, 300)
X, Y = np.meshgrid(x, y)

# Compute wave interference pattern
eta_sum = np.zeros_like(X)
for x0, y0 in sources:
    R = np.sqrt((X - x0)**2 + (Y - y0)**2)
    eta_sum += A / np.sqrt(R + 1e-6) * np.cos(k * R - omega * t)  # Avoid division by zero

# Plot the interference pattern
plt.figure(figsize=(8, 6))
plt.imshow(eta_sum, extent=[-30, 30, -30, 30], cmap='coolwarm', origin='lower')
plt.colorbar(label='Wave Amplitude')
plt.scatter(*zip(*sources), color='black', label='Wave Sources')
plt.legend()
plt.title('Interference Pattern for a Square Wave Source')
plt.xlabel('X Position')
plt.ylabel('Y Position')
plt.show()
```

## 4. Observations and Analysis  

1. **Amplification Zones**: Bright regions appear where waves align in phase, leading to reinforcement.  
2. **Cancellation Zones**: Dark areas emerge where waves are out of phase, resulting in destructive interference.  
3. **Symmetric Wave Patterns**: The interference pattern mirrors the symmetry of the selected polygonal arrangement.  

---

## 5. Conclusion  

This simulation illustrates the fundamental principles of wave interference. By adjusting the polygonal configuration and wave properties, we can explore diverse wave phenomena relevant to fields like acoustics, optics, and fluid mechanics.
